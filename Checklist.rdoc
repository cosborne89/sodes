- Edit "Edit" and "Back" on /new for journal and task so that they route to task#index or journal#index if :project_id doesn't exist. Should be straightforward ternary.

- Clean up indexes by
	d) Defining column width.

- Change some datetimes to just time. These are journal begin and end time, task due date, project due date

- Add validation so that description/title are needed for everything.

- Refactor application.css and organize with comments.

* - Clicking "Save" when Editing an existing creates a new record, probably because of the :method in the :url for the form_for. Occurs on tasks and journals and projects. Solution: put an if statement in the :method in the same manner as in the :url to use the update method instead of the create method. Have to know how to detect if its update or create (should try - it may already be baked in - cf. the button says Update vs Save).


- Got the best_in_place gem working by NOT copying the .js file into my vendor/assets but rather just by doing gem install best_in_place.
